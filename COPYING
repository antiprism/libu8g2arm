Copyright (from zip file)
Thanks for downloading one of codeman38's retro video game fonts, as seen on Memepool, BoingBoing, and all around the blogosphere.

So, you're wondering what the license is for these fonts? Pretty simple; it's based upon that used for Bitstream's Vera font set <http://www.gno me.org/fonts/>.

Basically, here are the key points summarized, in as little legalese as possible; I hate reading license agreements as much as you probably do:

With one specific exception, you have full permission to bundle these fonts in your own free or commercial projects-- and by projects, I'm refer ring to not just software but also electronic documents and print publications.

So what's the exception? Simple: you can't re-sell these fonts in a commercial font collection. I've seen too many font CDs for sale in stores t hat are just a repackaging of thousands of freeware fonts found on the internet, and in my mind, that's quite a bit like highway robbery. Note t hat this only applies to products that are font collections in and of themselves; you may freely bundle these fonts with an operating system, application program, or the like.

Feel free to modify these fonts and even to release the modified versions, as long as you change the original font names (to ensure consistency among people with the font installed) and as long as you give credit somewhere in the font file to codeman38 or zone38.net. I may even incorpora te these changes into a later version of my fonts if you wish to send me the modifed fonts via e-mail.

Also, feel free to mirror these fonts on your own site, as long as you make it reasonably clear that these fonts are not your own work. I'm not asking for much; linking to zone38.net or even just mentioning the nickname codeman38 should be enough.

Well, that pretty much sums it up... so without further ado, install and enjoy these fonts from the golden age of video games.

Bitstream Vera Fonts Copyright

The fonts have a generous copyright, allowing derivative works (as long as "Bitstream" or "Vera" are not in the names), and full redistribution (so long as they are not *sold* by themselves). They can be be bundled, redistributed and sold with any software.

The fonts are distributed under the following copyright:

The Font Software may be modified, altered, or added to, and in particular the designs of glyphs or characters in the Fonts may be modified and additional glyphs or characters may be added to the Fonts, only if the fonts are renamed to names not containing either the words "Bitstream" or the word "Vera".

This License becomes null and void to the extent applicable to Fonts or Font Software that has been modified and is distributed under the "Bitstream Vera" names.

Copyright FAQ

I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?

Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package, however.
I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and sale as part of a larger software package or system. Can I do so?

Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a "larger software package" to begin with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. See 1. above.
Are derivative works allowed?

Yes!
Can I change or add to the font(s)?

Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).
Under what terms are derivative works allowed?

You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig, substitutions could still could have occurred during font opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!
If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get adopted in future versions?

Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's design. Vera cannot become a "ransom note" font. Jim Lyles will be providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.
I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?

Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.
If applications have built the names "Bitstream Vera" into them, can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?

This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration, selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font names and substituting alternatives. An example is provided by the supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for "sans", "serif" and "monospace". Other software (e.g., the XFree86 core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.

This is a free font/file, distribute as you wish to who you wish. Do NOT sell this font within a CD or any other media; it's not yours and you can't make money of it. You'd rather ask me first via email, I may probably let you do it as long as it's for a good cause.

I don't know if the original Nokia font has some copyright which prevents people from making new fonts based on it. I hope not. Anyways, buy a Nokia, and I think everything's gonna be alright.

Special thanks on this version go out to Carlos Bêla (www.goldenshower.gs) and Diogo Kalil (www.sincolor.com.br) for helping me out with the Mac version of the font. It has been extensively tested to ensure it's as smooth (hint, kerning, spacing and aliasing-wise) as the pc one is.

README from the zip archive:

Inconsolata is one of the most suitable font for programmers created by Raph Levien. Since the original Inconsolata does not contain Cyrillic alphabet, it was slightly inconvenient for not a few programmers from Russia.

Inconsolata LGC is a modified version of Inconsolata with added the Cyrillic alphabet which directly descends from Inconsolata Hellenic supporting modern Greek.

Reference
The WenQuanYi bitmap fonts are maintained here: http://wenq.org/wqy2/.

The u8g2 fonts are based on the bdf files from here: https://github.com/larryli/u8g2_wqy

From the font files:

WenQuanYi bitmap fonts include all 20,932 Unicode 5.2 CJK Unified Ideographs (U4E00 - U9FA5) and 6,582 CJK Extension A characters (U3400 - U4DB5) at 5 different pixel sizes (9pt-12X12, 10pt-13X13, 10.5pt-14x14, 11pt-15X15 and 12pt-16x16 pixel). Use of this bitmap font for on-screen display of Chinese (traditional and simplified) in web pages and elsewhere eliminates the annoying "blurring" problems caused by insufficient "hinting" of anti-aliased vector CJK fonts. In addition, Latin characters, Japanese Kanas and Korean Hangul glyphs (U+AC00~U+D7A3) are also included.
